# Data Analytics Exam

The goal of this project is to recognize the year in which a song was published starting from the features of its audio track. Several Machine Learning models have been trained to achieve this goal. In particular:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- KNN
- Support Vector Regressor
- Neural Networks, Feed Forward Architecture
- Neural Networks, TabNet Architecture
- Neural Networks, Tab Transformer Architecture
